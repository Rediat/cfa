Abstract of the paper is as follows:

The dominant language groups under the family of Ethio-Semitic languages are Amharic, Geez, Guragigna and Tigrigna. In this research we have performed a comparative study of CFA and NBC over a training and test setting by making changes to the language models. Both classifiers commonly exhibited that their performance grows better when the length of the test document is grows from a single word to 2, 3 and beyond to reach beyond 99% in F-score. Tests are conducted in two different evaluation contexts with 10-fold validation on both CFA and NBC classifiers. Both classifiers performed similarly under the each context corresponding to the language models they n-grams. N=5 on Fixed length n-rams with location features language model is the optimal whereas N=2 is the optimal value of N for the remaining language models as tested both in CFA and NBC classification methods. The language model, fixed length n-rams with location features, exhibited higher F-score value for both classifiers and evaluation contexts.
